Welcome to my site! Here I share my thoughts on my technical work and some internal ramblings of my personal hobbies, namely tabletop roleplaying games and reading speculative fiction (science fiction & fantasy).

Some personal projects of mine are brushing up on my C++ knowledge, learning new languages such as Rust, and continuing to learn more about Linux/Unix based operating systems and making shell scripts, mainly in Bash.

I currently have a few devices that I work off of right now. I have a custom PC currently using Windows 10, a Dell XPS 15 9570 (2018) which is currently running Fedora, and I have a Raspberry Pi 4 that I have a few services running on as well as using it as a Linux test environment to remote into.
